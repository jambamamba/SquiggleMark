SquiggleMark uses these open source software and libraries to watermark and resize images and videos.

FFMpeg: FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. This software uses libraries from the FFmpeg project under the LGPLv2.1. The actual watermarking of videos is done by FFmpeg, and not SquiggleMark.

Theora/Vorbis/Ogg: Theora is an open video codec being developed by the Xiph.org Foundation as part of their Ogg project (It is a project that aims to integrate On2's VP3 video codec, Ogg Vorbis audio codec and Ogg multimedia container formats into a multimedia solution that can compete with MPEG-4 format). Theora is targeted at competing with MPEG-4 (e.g., XviD and DivX), RealVideo, Windows Media Video, and similar lower-bitrate video compression schemes. 

Vorbis is an audio codec, Theora is a video codec. Ogg is the transport layer that both are stored in, so a video file will be Theora-encoded data inside an Ogg file, while audio is normally Vorbis-encoded data inside an ogg file.

FreeType: FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts. SquiggleMark uses FreeType library to render fonts for the purpose of watermarking images.

Libjpeg: Libjpeg is a widely used C library for reading and writing JPEG image files. It was developed by Tom Lane and the Independent JPEG Group (IJG) during the 1990's. SquiggleMark uses Libjpeg for processing JPEG image files.

OpenSSL: OpenSSL is an open source project that provides a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols. This product includes cryptographic software written by Eric Young. This product includes software written by Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com). SquiggleMark uses OpenSSL libraries to encrypt and decrypt files.
